              <p>
                I am a proactive and analytical Knowledge Engineering student passionate
                about bridging the gap between complex business operations and
                technology. My goal is to leverage technology to drive
                efficiency and build a long-term career in technology consulting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I am an <strong>IT Production Services Intern at HSBC
                Vietnam</strong>. In this role, I work within an ITIL-based
                environment to analyze and resolve critical business process
                disruptions. I connect business users with technical teams
                to maintain core banking applications and have also designed
                a BI dashboard using Power BI to transform incident data into
                actionable insights for stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before HSBC, I was a <strong>Research Intern at DPNM Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea</strong>, where I
                led a study on a high-performance crypto back-testing platform
                using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
              </p>

                My academic background at VNUHCM University of Science and
                hands-on projects in NLP and data visualization
                have equipped me with a strong foundation in both software
                engineering and data analysis.
              </p>
