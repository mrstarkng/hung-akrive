Designing a cohesive digital presence meant bringing the same polish from the blog into a standalone
project experience. I used the MDX pipeline that already powers the blog to model the project
brief, technical decisions, and outcomes. The dashboard itself pulls from mocked analytics data and
renders it with dynamic chart components that respond to the user's theme preference.

## Features shipped

- **Unified content pipeline.** Project case studies live alongside blog posts, which means I can
  use identical frontmatter, MDX components, and deployment flows without additional tooling.
- **Category driven discovery.** Tagging projects with shared categories makes it easy to surface
  related posts and deep dives directly from the new Projects page.
- **Responsive storytelling.** Every section of the page adapts from mobile through desktop,
  preserving context and readability regardless of where it's viewed.

## Lessons learned

Reusing the existing MDX setup kept the work focused on experience instead of infrastructure. The
new Projects page now acts as a curated hub for hands-on work, with category filters that tie back
into the broader taxonomy already established on the site.
